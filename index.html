<h1>My name is Emily</h1>

    <p>
        I am 25 years old and currently working towards a degree in marketing while attending Code Fellows. Prior to attending school I worked as a bartender for about 3 years. I have done a number of jobs other than that, including; Arcade repairs for Bandai Namco, skin care instructor for Sephora, and pet nutritionist. As far as my goals go, I would like to get a remote job after Code Fellows and build a house van to travel around the United States with my dog Blanche.
